# Quarto Manuscript Project Template

This is a template repo intended to speed up the process of setting up a new
project as a [Quarto manuscript](https://quarto.org/docs/manuscripts/).

It is a collection of literate computing notebooks (`.qmd` files) and related
source code. A lightweight virtual environment is already included via the
[`renv` package](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html). The
organizational structure is as follows

* `data/` contains raw data for an analysis
* `notebooks/` contains literate computing notebooks implementing analyses or
  tools for analyses
* `simulations/` contains source code for (statistical) simulation experiments
